# command-line-personal-assistant
This is a command line peronal assistant, programmed using python. under which you perform only some basic task like download videos play music make folder and files play games etc. because its a 0.1.1 version. Later i will work on it and upgrade as soon as possible.
if you want to use this, you have a python installed system. otherwise it will not run
if you want to play music then you have to enter the extension of song like mp3 otherwise it will show an error.
Or if any error rise and you have the knowledge to solve it, then go for it. lets contribute to this project and take it this to another level.
